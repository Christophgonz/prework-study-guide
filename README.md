# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I wanted to make this project in order to complete my prework, however I believe it is incredibly important to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It is a collection of notes that I learned from completing prework on how to implement all of the above and how to also deploy it to a website. The project is the proof of the information that I have learned.
